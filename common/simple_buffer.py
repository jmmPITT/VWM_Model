class ReplayBuffer:
    """
    A simple replay buffer for storing transitions.

    The buffer stores experiences for a fixed number of episodes (buffer_size) and each
    episode can store up to mem_size transitions. Transitions include state, action,
    reward, next state, and terminal flag.

    Attributes:
        mem_size (int): Maximum number of transitions per episode.
        buffer_size (int): Number of episodes maintained in the buffer.
        mem_cntr (np.ndarray): Array tracking the number of transitions stored per episode.
        alpha (float): Priority exponent used to compute priority (if needed).
        state_memory (np.ndarray): Buffer for states.
        next_state_memory (np.ndarray): Buffer for next states.
        action_memory (np.ndarray): Buffer for actions.
        reward_memory (np.ndarray): Buffer for rewards.
        terminal_memory (np.ndarray): Buffer for terminal flags.
